## 1. Create Cloud9 instance for development

1.1\. Open the AWS Cloud9 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/.

1.2\. Click on **Create environment**.

1.3\. Type a Name of `MyDevelopmentInstance`, and choose **Next step**.

1.4\. Leave the default configuration and choose **Next step**.

1.5\. Click on **Create environment**.

1.6\. Now inside the **bash** terminal clone the reposiotry with `git clone https://github.com/aurbac/laravel-our-experiences.git`.

## 2. Create CodeCommit repository

2.1\. Open the AWS CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories.

2.2\. Click on **Create repository**.

2.3\. Type a Repository name of `OurExperiences`, and choose **Create**.

2.4\. Click on **Clone URL** and choose **Clone HTTPS**, the URL is now copied: https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/OurExperiences

2.5\. Inside your Cloud9 environment got to the project folder `cd /home/ec2-user/environment/laravel-our-experiences/`.

2.6\. Configure Git credentials executing `git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'` and `git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true`.

2.7\. Add a new remote for the local project by executing `git remote add codecommit https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/OurExperiences`.

2.8\. And push to code commit with `git push codecommit`. Now you can refresh your CodeCommit repository and you will see the code.

3.5\. On the Review page, type a name for the role `WebServerRole` and choose **Create role**.

## 4. Create EC2 Instance WebServer

In User data you are passing sentences to install web server, install CodeDeploy agent, download code from CodeCommit and configure Laravel application.

4.9\. Choose **Next: Add Storage** and **Next: Add Tags**.

4.10\. In **Step 5: Add Tags**, choose **Add Tag**, in **Key** type `Name` and in **Value** type `WebServer`, add another tag with **Key** as `Environment` and **Value** as `Production`, and choose **Next: Configure Security Groups**.
